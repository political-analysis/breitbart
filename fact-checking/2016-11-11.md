**OPINION**

"Mexico folds on NAFTA" is a statement of analogy. Literally it can be interpreted as making an analogy between Mexico's change in stance on NAFTA (as reported in the AFP) and the act of folding in the game of poker. Whether such an analogy exists is not a factual question.

# [TWITTER EXPLODES WITH TRUMP ASSASSINATION FANTASIES](https://web.archive.org/web/20161111001026/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/10/twitter-explodes-donald-trump-assassination-fantasies/)

**MISLEADING**

Breitbart cites seven tweets fantasizing about Donald Trump and/or Mike Pence being assassinated, as well as one tweet making the observation that some are having such fantasies. The President receives death threats on a constant basis, though the Secret Service will not say how many occur (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHkvtmEyas8, 13:00-15:00).

There is nothing implausible about Breitbart's characterization that there has been a significant and notable increase in talk of assassinating Trump and Pence since they won the election. However, the handful of examples they provide do not provide convincing evidence that there has been such a significant and notable increase, against a backdrop where the President is constantly recieving death threats, and we don't know from the Secret Service how numerous they are.
