# ~~LOVE TRUMPS~~ HATE: THE LEFT'S VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST TRUMP SUPPORTERS

**NON-STATEMENT**

This article is a list of attacks against Trump supporters. The headline itself is not a sentence, and so it is neither true nor false.

# REID LIED ABOUT ROMNEY'S TAXES: NOW LIES ABOUT TRUMP, BANNON...

**OPINION: Reid lied about Romney's taxes** 

Breitbart argues Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney's taxes on the Senate floor, saying Romney paid taxes for 10 years without offering evidence. Breitbart cites the Congressional record:

Relevant quote:

The statement Breitbart is disputing is "the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years." Whether this was a lie depends on how we interpret Reid's statement and what we consider to constitute a lie. For example, Reid's statement could also be considered an unsubstantiated claim, or spreading a rumor. If Reid believed what he was saying, but lacked evidence, his statement was probably not a lie, but simply an unsubstantiated claim. Therefore our judgment is that whether Reid lied about Romney's taxes is a matter of opinion.

**FALSE: Reid lies about Trump, Bannon**

Breitbart quotes Harry Reid as saying:

> According to [Southern] Poverty Law Center, Bannon “was the main driver between [sic] Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill.” When asked to comment on Bannon’s hiring, KKK leader David Duke told CNN, “I think that’s excellent.”

Source for David Duke quote: http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/white-nationalists-on-bannon/

The statements Reid is quoted as making are literally true; the sources mentioned made the statements mentioned. Therefore Breitbart's claim that he lied is false, at least understanding their claim as saying that the quote they cited was a lie.

# OBAMA TEARS UP DRILLING PERMITS TO STOP COLORADO ENERGY BOOM

**OPINION**

Breitbart cites the following Department of Interior press release describing the termination of oil and gas leases in the White River National Forest in Colorado:

https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-jewell-announces-resolution-oil-gas-leasing-issues-colorados-white-river

It's not confirmed that Obama was involved in this decision, but the Obama administration was. It's a common way of speaking to attribute everything a President's administration does to the President themselves. Interpreted this way, the statement is true. Interpreted as meaning that Obama was directly involved in the decision, it's unverified.

The claim of the headline, though, is that the drilling permits were revoked in order to stop a Colorado energy boom. This is a specious assessment of the purpose of the decision; the DOI press release states that the purposes included "protecting one of Colorado’s most spectacular places and important watersheds, and ensuring that any future development is done responsibly and held to high standards."

However, Breitbart could argue that we can't assume their stated motivations are their actual motivations. Breitbart's narrative is that "President Obama claims that he is Advancing American Energy, but the president has continually fought America’s oil and gas energy boom and spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars each year to advance weak solar and wind power." By placing this decision into this narrative, they articulate what seems to us to be a legitimate opinion about the motivation behind the White River National Forest decision.

**FALSE**

The article is unrelated to the headline. The headline you get after clicking into the article is: "Franken Urges Trump ‘to Appeal to America’s Better Angels’ and Reject Stephen Bannon." The rest of the article is about statements by Al Franken:
