**NON-STATEMENT**

This article is a list of attacks against Trump supporters. The headline itself is not a sentence, and so it is neither true nor false.

# REID LIED ABOUT ROMNEY'S TAXES: NOW LIES ABOUT TRUMP, BANNON...

**OPINION: Reid lied about Romney's taxes** 

Breitbart argues Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney's taxes on the Senate floor, saying Romney paid taxes for 10 years without offering evidence. Breitbart cites the Congressional record:

The statement Breitbart is disputing is "the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years." Whether this was a lie depends on how we interpret Reid's statement and what we consider to constitute a lie. For example, Reid's statement could also be considered an unsubstantiated claim, or spreading a rumor. If Reid believed what he was saying, but lacked evidence, his statement was probably not a lie, but simply an unsubstantiated claim. Therefore our judgment is that whether Reid lied about Romney's taxes is a matter of opinion.

**FALSE: Reid lies about Trump, Bannon**

Breitbart quotes Harry Reid as saying:

> According to [Southern] Poverty Law Center, Bannon “was the main driver between [sic] Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill.” When asked to comment on Bannon’s hiring, KKK leader David Duke told CNN, “I think that’s excellent.”

The statements Reid is quoted as making are literally true; the sources mentioned made the statements mentioned. Therefore Breitbart's claim that he lied is false, at least understanding their claim as saying that the quote they cited was a lie.

**TRUE: Harry 'concerned' the 'world was going to end' after Trump election 'trauma'**

The video linked in the article confirms Reid used the phrases quoted in the way suggested by the quotes:
