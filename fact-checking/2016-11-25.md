# [MR. 306: TRUMP WINS MICHIGAN, FIRST REPUBLICAN TO DO SO SINCE 1988 *EXTENDS ELECTORAL COLLEGE LANDSLIDE*](http://web.archive.org/web/20161125013823/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/24/trump-wins-michigan-first-republican-since-1988/)

**TRUE: Trump wins Michigan**

Results in Michigan "have been canvassed and certified by county canvassing boards, but are unofficial until certified by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers on Nov. 28," [according to the Michigan Secretary of State](http://web.archive.org/web/20161125171845/http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8722_76444-397762--,00.html). This page verifies Breitbart's claim that "Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes after results from all 83 of the state‚Äôs county clerks were counted and certified."

**TRUE: Trump first Republican to win Michigan since 1988**

The claim that Trump is the first Republican to win Michigan since 1988 can be checked in the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/index.html).

**TRUE: Hostages freed after gunman storms Catholic monk retirement home in France**

The Daily Mail confirms: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3969686/Armed-man-enters-retirement-home-monks-near-Montpellier-France.html

**MISLEADING: 2+ dead**

A snapshot of the Daily Mail article from around the time of the Breitbart article's publication reports two alleged deaths, a man and a woman, but states that the death of the man is not confirmed: http://web.archive.org/web/20161125064647/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3969686/Armed-man-enters-retirement-home-monks-near-Montpellier-France.html

As of this writing (11/25/16, 3:54 PM ET) the latest version of the Daily Mail article has not been updated to confirm or deny the death of the man.

# [BREXIT BACKER TO SUE CNN AFTER ON-AIR KREMLIN CLAIM?](http://web.archive.org/web/20161125015240/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/24/brexit-backer-instructs-lawyers-cnns-josh-rogin-implies-kremlin-connections/)

**SOLE SOURCE**

The most literal interpretation of this headline is that it is a question, which would make it neither true nor false, and therefore a non-statement. However, this is not the correct interpretation, because Breitbart is not asking the reader whether the statement in the headline is the case. A better interpretation is that in this case the question mark expresses doubt about whether the lawsuit will really occur. Breitbart's claim in the article substantiating the headline is:

"Mr. Banks has since informed Breitbart London that he has already instructed lawyers to investigate a defamation claim against CNN or Mr. Rogin."

A quick Google search didn't turn up an independent confirmation of the claim (though, as always, this isn't necessarily a reason to doubt the claim).

**TRUE**

This terse headline is trying to say that Trump is talking with Carrier about keeping a plant of theirs in the USA. Breitbart cites two tweets, one from Carrier and one from Trump:

# [üçóHAPPY THANKSGIVING: MEDIA FINALLY ADMIT THEY HAVE A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM, FACE INDUSTRY-WIDE TRUST CRISISüçó](http://web.archive.org/web/20161125014657/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/24/happy-thanksgiving-media-admit-credibility-problem/)

**OPINION**

Breitbart expands on the headline's claim, writing:

   Several top reporters at establishment media outlets are finally admitting, more than two weeks after the election, that their industry has a credibility problem and has much work to do to regain the trust of their readers in the wake of Republican Donald J. Trump‚Äôs landslide electoral college victory over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

They quote from radio interviews on Breitbart News Daily with Jeremy Peters (New York Times), Jonathan Swan (The Hill), Joshua Green (Bloomberg Businessweek), Robert Costa (Washington Post), Corey Lewandowski (formerly at CNN, now being considered for a position in Trump administration), and Ann Coulter (bestselling author, syndicated columnist, former MSNBC legal correspondent, Trump supporter, etc.).

 * The comments they quote from Peters are narrow in scope, dealing with the problem of the reliability of polling.
 * The comments they quote from Swan are broad in scope, dealing with the problem of media bias (my words, not Swan's) in election coverage, resulting from hiring practices which tend to result in reporters at major media outlets having homogeneous and non-representative political views.
 * Green's comments cover similar ground, touching on the issue of the reliability of polling, fake news, and a "state of introspection" in the media resulting from "all this stuff swirling around at once."
 * The paragraph where Breitbart quotes Costa is:
     ‚ÄúThere are so many factors,‚Äù Costa replied when asked about what the legacy media outlets missed this election cycle. ‚ÄúBut I think it starts with, you have to listen to voters, and you have to have an open mind when you listen to voters.‚Äù
 * Breitbart quotes Lewandowski discussing an MRC/YouGov poll where (as Lewandowski characterizes it) 97% of those polled said that they did not allow the media's bias to affect their voting decisions. Lewandowski interprets this as meaning that the 97% of those polled who answered "yes" to this question were tacitly admitting that the media was biased, and that the people who gave this answer weren't listening to them anymore. It's worth mentioning that this is a specious interpretation of the data. People are unlikely to believe that they are influenced by media bias, whether they are or not. Moreover, the question as stated by Lewandowski is a loaded question, which assumes that the media is biased. A person could reasonably respond that they were not influenced by media bias and hold the belief that the media sources they consume are not very biased.
 * Ann Coulter is quoted praising Trump for his oppositional stance towards the media, and his lack of need to seek their approval. 

The evidence Breitbart presents includes a handful of media figures endorsing versions of a few claims related to the headline:

 * That the media's 2016 election coverage was biased.
 * That a lot of people don't trust the media.
 * That the media's 2016 election coverage was flawed because of the predictive shortcomings of the polling the media reported on.
 * That the media is facing new challenges and is in a state of introspection to understand how to sustain their operations effectively in the future.

In the big picture, the interviews quoted are the opinions of a few media figures, and the headline claim is neither strictly true nor strictly false. Therefore we rate this headline an opinion.

# [LIMBAUGH: ‚ÄòTRUE STORY OF THANKSGIVING‚Äô REJECTION OF SOCIALISM](http://web.archive.org/web/20161125010136/http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/11/24/limbaugh-true-story-thanksgiving-rejection-socialism/)

**TRUE**

The claim of this headline should not be understood to be the claim that the true story of Thanksgiving is the rejection of socialism. Rather, it should be understood to be the claim that Limbaugh characterizes the true story of Thanksgiving to be the rejetion of socialism. Limbaugh does not literally say that the rejection of socialism is the true story of Thanksgiving. Limbaugh tells the story of the Pilgrims, and his retelling asserts they originally used a socialist system where all the community's assets were communally owned, and that they abandoned this system due to its perceived inefficiency. When Limbaugh uses the literal phrase "true story of Thanksgiving," he does so in this context:

   Remember, the Pilgrims preceded the founding of the country by hundreds of years.  They really were the ones that got it started and showed how it could be done.  And it was ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to use the word ‚Äúrich.‚Äù  It was so plentiful, this was what they were thankful for.  They thanked God for the guidance found in the Bible for restructuring their community, and shared their bounty with the Indians, who did teach them how to do things they didn‚Äôt know how to do, basically be farmers.  That‚Äôs The True Story of Thanksgiving.

When referring to "the guidance found in the Bible for restructuring their community," Limbaugh seems to be referring to William Bradford's decision to privatize the Pilgrims' land, giving it to individual families in replacement of the collective ownership system. Limbaugh qoutes Bradford as saying:

   The experience that we had in this common course and condition. The experience that we had in this common course and condition tried sundry years‚Ä¶that by taking away property, and bringing community into a common wealth, would make them happy and flourishing ‚Äî as if they were wiser than God.

This quote supports the notion that Limbaugh is characterizing Bradford as having had religious justifications for privatizing the Pilgrims' land. Therefore it seems to be accurate that Limbaugh is characterizing the rejection of socialism as part of the true story of Thanksgiving.
