Factual Accuracy
----------------

Planned to do a study of the factual accuracy of Breitbart. Proposed data collection methodology:

 * Take a sample of dates in the past. The sample will be added to incrementally, and it will
   consist of the Fridays in all weeks starting from the week of Nov. 18 2016 and adding
   data incrementally forwards and backwards in time.
 * Use archive.org to get the front page of Breitbart on that day, using whichever snapshot is
   closest in time to 12PM EST.
 * Categorize each headline into one of the following categories (make more if necessary):
     true, false, unverifiable, opinion, misleading
   In each case record the explanation for the categorization (e.g., verified by an independent,
   credible source, refuted by an independent, credible source, etc.)

Data analysis methodology will be to give a count of the number of headlines in each of the categories.

The foregoing data should tell us how accurate Breitbart headlines typically are. In addition, we should develop a running log of all known false statements Breitbart has made.
