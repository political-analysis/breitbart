Factual Accuracy
----------------

Planned to do a study of the factual accuracy of Breitbart. Proposed data collection methodology:

 * Take a sample of dates in the past.
 * Use archive.org to get the front page of Breitbart on that day.
 * Categorize each headline into one of the following categories (make more if necessary):
     true, false, unverifiable, opinion, misleading
   In each case record the explanation for the categorization (e.g., verified by an independent,
   credible source, refuted by an independent, credible source, etc.)

Data analysis methodology remains to be fleshed out.

The foregoing data should tell us how accurate Breitbart headlines typically are. In addition, we should develop a running log of all known false statements Breitbart has made.
